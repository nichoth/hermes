## Inviting Others (Option 1) ##

Hermes asks permission for access to user’s phone contacts: allows user to send a friend request to those on the platform, as well as invite those who are not.
- Problem: Is this a privacy risk? Can we assure the user that we will delete or not store the info after? This would become an issue of trust.


## Inviting Others (Option 2) ##

User shares a Hermes-only link to a user through text or email asking others to join or to be a friend through the platform.
- Problem: Onus on the user to share though text/email, and invite friends one-by-one.
- Problem: If the invitee isn't on platform, they would have to first download the app, sign up, and then go back to the original invite link to then befriend.

## Inviting Others (Option 3) ##

The invite link is a URL containing a query string of inviter’s profile. Once user is directed and not a Hermes user, it would prompt them to create an account. Thereafter, it redirects user to profile of inviter.

- Problem: URLs are browser-dependent, so this would entail designing for desktop, too. The potential new user wouldn’t be able to see all functionalities.

- Problem: Defeats the purpose of privacy and encryption, since the online data has no way of encryption.

- Problem: The original problem of how to send invite still exists.
