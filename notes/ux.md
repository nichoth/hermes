## Inviting Option 1 ##

Hermes asks permission for access to user’s phone contacts. This allows the user to send a friend request to those on the platform, as well as invite those who are not.
- There's an element of trust.


## Inviting Option 2 ##

User shares a Hermes-only link to a user through text or email asking others to join or to be a friend through the platform.
- Onus is on the user to share though text/email, and invite friends one-by-one.
- Problem: If the invitee isn't on platform, they would have to first download the app, sign up, and then go back to the original invite link to then befriend.

## Invite Link ##

The invite link is a URL containing a query string of inviter’s profile. If a non-user is directed, it would prompt them to create an account, and thereafter, redirects to the profile of inviter.

- URLs are browser-dependent, so this would entail designing for desktop, too, and the potential new user wouldn’t be able to see all functionalities.
